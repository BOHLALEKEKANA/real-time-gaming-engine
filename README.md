# real-time gaming engine

A real-time gaming engine is a complex task that typically involves multiple components like rendering, physics, input handling, and more. Below, I'll provide a simplified C++ example of a basic real-time game engine structure using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and input handling. This example will include a basic game loop, rendering system, and entity management to demonstrate core concepts. For a full-fledged engine, you’d typically integrate additional systems like physics (e.g., using Box2D), audio, and scripting, but this will serve as a starting point.

Prerequisites:
Install SFML: Ensure SFML is installed and linked correctly in your project (e.g., via CMake or your IDE).
Compiler: A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., g++).
Libraries: SFML for graphics, window management, and input.

Game Engine Features:

Game Loop: Manages updates and rendering at a fixed time step.
Entity System: Basic entity management for game objects.
Rendering: Draws simple shapes (e.g., circles) using SFML.
Input Handling: Processes keyboard input for basic movement.

How It Works:

Entity Class: Represents game objects with position, velocity, and a visual representation (SFML’s CircleShape).

GameEngine Class:

Initializes an SFML window.
Manages a list of entities.
Handles input (WASD for moving the first entity).
Updates entity positions based on velocity and time step.
Renders entities to the window.

Game Loop: Runs at 60 FPS, processing input, updating game state, and rendering.
Main Function: Creates an engine instance, adds two entities (one controllable), and starts the loop.
Compilation and Running

To compile and run this code:

Install SFML (e.g., sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev on Ubuntu or equivalent).
Compile with SFML libraries linked:
g++ -c game_engine.cpp -o game_engine.o
g++ game_engine.o -o game_engine -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

Run the executable:

./game_engine

Controls:
WASD: Move the first entity (green circle).
Close Window: Click the window’s close button to exit.

Extending the Engine:
To make this a more robust game engine, you could:

Add a physics system (e.g., using Box2D for collisions).
Implement a scene graph for hierarchical transformations.
Add audio support with SFML’s audio module.
Create a component-based architecture for entities (e.g., components for rendering, physics, scripting).
Support scripting (e.g., Lua integration) for game logic.
